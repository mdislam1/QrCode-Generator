# QR Code Generator

This Python script generates a QR code that links to an online resume PDF. It also adds a text label below the QR code, prompting users to scan it to view the resume. The final image is saved as `qrcode.png`.

---

## Features

- **QR Code Generation**: Creates a QR code linking to a resume hosted online.
- **Customizable Text**: Adds a text label below the QR code (e.g., "Scan to view my resume").
- **Image Customization**: Allows customization of QR code colors and text font size.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple and straightforward script with minimal dependencies.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need the following Python libraries:

- `qrcode`
- `Pillow` (PIL)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/qr-resume.git](https://github.com/mdislam1/qr-code-generator.git)
cd qr_code
```

2. Modify the script to update the resume link or customize the text and colors:

```python
qr.add_data('https://mdislam1.github.io/resume-host/Md_Islam_Resume.pdf')  # Replace with your resume link
